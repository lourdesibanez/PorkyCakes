# Sistema Porky Cakes
This repository contains the source code and documentation of the system developed for the "Porky Cakes" pastry shop. The system addresses various aspects, ranging from static design to the implementation of design patterns such as Facade, Singleton, and DAO with Abstract Factory. User access information is also logged in a record file, and the architecture is documented using Clemens' components and connectors view.
